# Battery Modeling Examples



## Getting started

Open the project "BatteryModelExamples."

Go to "PROJECT SHORTCUTS."

Run and explore the three examples from the "PROJECT SHORTCUTS."


## Description of the Examples

A series of examples to demonstrate how to build battery models using Simscape Battery to consider electrical and thermal coupled behavior.

Example 1: a single cell model, with voltage behavior described by an equivalent circuit model (ECM) and thermal behavior described by a lumped thermal mass model.

Example 2: a single cell model, with voltage behavior described by an equivalent circuit model (ECM) and thermal behavior described by a height distributed mass model.

Example 3: a battery pack model, with active cooling. This example also highlights how to quickly scale up from cells to modules and pack using Battery Builder.
